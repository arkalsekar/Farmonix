# 🌱 Farmonix – Intelligent Precision Pesticide Spraying Rover  

> “Farmonix sprays it right, keeping farming future bright”  

---

## 📌 Overview  
Indian farmers lose up to **40% of crops annually** due to pest infestations. To combat this, they spend over **₹70,000 crores on pesticides every year** — but nearly **1/3rd is wasted** due to blind blanket spraying. This leads to:  
- Reduced soil fertility  
- Water contamination & biodiversity loss  
- Farmers exposed to toxic chemicals  
- Lower yields & rising debts  

**Farmonix** solves this by introducing an **AI-powered autonomous rover** that sprays pesticides **only where infection is detected**, ensuring **zero waste, higher yield, and safer farming**.

## 🚀 Features  
- **🤖 Autonomous Rover** – Navigates across fields and sprays only infected areas.  
- **🧠 AI Pest Detection** – Real-time crop health monitoring with CNN models & image processing.  
- **🗣️ Multilingual AI Assistant** – Voice-guided farmer support in **English & Hindi**.  
- **📊 Smart Dashboard & Reports** – Mobile app with pest alerts, spray usage, rover location, and crop health insights.  
- **♻️ Eco-Smart Optimization** – 30–40% pesticide savings, protecting soil, water & environment.  
- **🧩 Modular Design** – Supports add-ons like fertilizer spraying, soil testing, and yield mapping.

## 🛠️ Technical Approach  

**AI & Software**  
- CNN (TensorFlow/Keras) for pest & disease detection  
- OpenCV for image processing  
- Python backend + MQTT for IoT communication  
- Mobile app: React / Flutter  
- APIs: Node.js / Flask  
- Cloud: AWS / GCP for analytics  

**Hardware**  
- Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano (edge computing)  
- HD Camera for real-time monitoring  
- Solenoid-controlled nozzles for targeted spraying  
- GPS & ultrasonic sensors for navigation  
- Tank level sensors for auto-refill detection  
- Chassis frame + wheels + power unit

## 📈 Feasibility & Viability  
- **Adoption Potential:** 85% of Indian farmers are smallholders → strong market fit.  
- **Cost Advantage:** ~1/5th cost of drones → affordable for small & marginal farmers.  
- **Business Model:** Rover-as-a-service (shared among farmer groups).  
- **Impact:**  
  - 30–40% reduction in pesticide usage → saves ₹7k–10k/season.  
  - 15–20% higher yields → better income.  
  - 70% less farmer exposure to harmful chemicals.  
  - Sustainable agriculture with less soil & water pollution.
